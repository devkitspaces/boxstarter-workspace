## Summary

A set of chocolatey packages for setting up a Windows PC.

## Getting Started

The packages are not available on `chocolatey.org`, so they will need to be manually built. You can pack them up using the following:

```bash
cd src/baseenv

choco pack
```

This will create a package.
